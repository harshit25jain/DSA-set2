/*
1.I first count the frequency of each character using a map. 
2.For building a palindrome, I add the full count of all even-frequency characters. 
3.For odd frequencies, I use count - 1 so that it becomes even and fits on both sides of the palindrome.
4.If thereâ€™s at least one odd-count character, I add 1 to place it in the center.
5.This ensures I get the maximum possible palindrome length.
6.The variable k acts as a flag to track if any character has an odd frequency.*/
